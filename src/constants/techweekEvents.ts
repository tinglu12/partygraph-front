This session will provide an in-depth look at the opportunities and challenges of investing in the robotics sector, focusing on the technologies that are truly reshaping industries, from hardware breakthroughs to AI-driven automation. Our panel of industry leaders, investors, and technologists will offer valuable insights into the practicalities of funding robotics ventures and what it takes to succeed in a market that is as fast-paced as it is complex.",

      "Social media has become the greatest source of corporate and brand crises, replacing what was once a slow-moving, word-of-mouth or traditional media issue. However, social media is often overlooked as a solution for crisis preparedness and response. Amplified by volatility within the current geo-political climate, as well as a new US administration, rollback of DEI initiatives, heightened public sensitivity and growing scrutiny around social issues; it is more important than ever that organizations consider digital and social media preparedness within their larger crisis communications and brand reputation strategies. Join Clarity Global for an expert panel conversation to discover actionable insights and advice on how to protect and manage your brand and corporate reputation. Following the panel, digital and social crisis simulation experts from Polpeo and Clarity Global will run group workshop simulations for pre-registered attendees. Participants will experience the high-pressure of a real crisis in a controlled setting, ensuring they are ready when the stakes are real.",

After the opening flow, the group will divide for two immersive breakout experiences: KamaFlight – a liberating aerial movement practice led by an all-female team of expert instructors, designed to help you move with intention, reclaim joy, and build embodied trust. Mobot Recovery – a deep recovery session led by Mobot founder Lani Cooper, using Mobot’s patented foam roller water bottles to combine hydration, release, and rejuvenation.

You might be feeling a knot in your stomach lately; the same feeling you get thinking about climate change, watching democratic norms fall like so many dominoes, or seeing kids glued to their screens, frying their attention spans, having algorithms permanently impact their brain development—a feeling of helplessness. We post. We protest. We panic. But nothing changes. What if there were a solution? This goes beyond a presentation - it's an invitation to reclaim power. Spartacus.app is a weapon that ordinary people like us have been waiting for. Drawing on insights from Game Theory, it combines conditional pledges and temporary anonymity to create something revolutionary: a means for the powerless to gain power. Think about it: Why don't people speak up? Because it's not \"worth it.\" The risk is too high, the reward too uncertain. But what if you knew you weren't alone? What if you knew exactly how many others would stand with you? That's what Spartacus does. It builds critical mass. And numbers equal leverage, protection, and impact. Whether you're building communities, organizing unions, gathering signatures, exposing corruption, fighting bullies, or starting a revolution within your organization, Spartacus makes taking action worth it. Join us in NYC on June 4. Bring your frustrations, your dreams, and your most provocative ideas about politics, activism, and tech. We'll play a coordination game that will blow your mind, demo the platform that could change everything, and talk about the collective action problems facing humanity, including the opportunities and risks presented by AI.",

      "Prompting is a common first point of contact between people and large language models (LLMs), and the quality of the prompt heavily influences the output of the model, the successful maintenance of system guardrails, and the overall user experience. Prompt creation is often highly dependent on specialized knowledge and can be challenging for non-AI experts because it’s iterative, time consuming, and prompting practices are constantly evolving. To address these problems, Responsible Prompting is an LLM-agnostic, lightweight recommender system that aims to dynamically support users in crafting prompts that reflect responsible intentions and help avoid undesired or negative outputs. In this workshop, we will show how Responsible Prompting API works and how it can be customized to your needs. This event is hosted by the AI Alliance, a collaborative network of companies, startups, universities, research institutions, government organizations, and non-profit foundations working at the forefront of AI technology to create the future of open, safe, and responsible AI.

To help us tackle these big questions, we partnered together with Gloo, https://gloo.com/, the biggest name in faith‑tech, (yes, the one Pat Gelsinger now leads tech for). We are bringing together a panel of expert speakers—Christians working in AI and machine learning—who are actively engaging with the challenges and opportunities this technology presents. Plus other special guests you don't want to miss! Together, we’ll explore: - What ethical frameworks should guide innovation in tech? - In a world shaped by algorithms, how do we hold onto what’s truly human? - And other questions like should AI be used in the church? What is a values-aligned AI exactly and how does it affect us? And as tech professionals, how do we get involved? Whether you work in tech, are exploring your faith, or are just curious about the future, this event will challenge and encourage you to think deeply about your role in shaping a better world through AI. Come for the conversation, stay for the community. All are welcome! -Snacks, beer, wine, and refreshments provided. -Come network with 150+ other founders, funders, and tech professionals. -Come meet the Gloo team (they're hiring!) and other big names in the tech space.

We have 12 Venture Capitalists who are excited to hear your pitch. Let’s be real: most founders take too long to get to the point. You have less than 20 seconds to capture an investor’s interest, yet traditional pitches drag on and lose impact. The Pitch Lift is a mini accelerator that helps you craft and test your messaging in a fast, fun, and effective way. Here’s how it works: •100+ founders get the chance to pitch VCs—inside an actual elevator. •Beforehand, you’ll join a virtual coaching session to perfect your 20-second pitch. •Your pitch is filmed and projected at the event for live feedback on how well you delivered. After pitching, you can get direct feedback from VCs, connect with other founders, watch more pitches, or just enjoy the vibe. This event is 95% founders and investors, ensuring high-quality connections and real opportunities. We’ve hosted five Pitch Lift events so far, leading to millions in term sheets.

    description:
      "Carry and Shopify NY are teaming up to host an evening for NYC’s founders, builders, and investors focused on one of the most powerful and underrated growth levers in tech: community. As acquisition costs rise and customer loyalty becomes harder to earn, the brands breaking through aren’t just building products, they’re building communities that stick (and actually show up). This panel brings the best of the best (announced soon) who’ve done exactly that. We’ll dive into what it really takes to create communities that drive engagement, retention, and lasting brand love, plus what most people get wrong when trying to do it. If you're building a brand people talk about, show up for, and stay loyal to, this conversation is for you. Join us for an energizing panel, drinks, and connection with NYC’s best in tech.",

This panel will unpack how SEO doesn’t exist in a silo but thrives at the intersection of clear brand positioning, compelling content, and a consistent social presence. The session is designed to show founders and marketers how to stop treating SEO like a checklist and treat it like a growth engine that connects all marketing functions. Discussion topics: \n* SEO as a strategic foundation: How keyword research can inform not just blog titles, but your brand language, content direction, and even product naming. \n* Brand strategy meets search: Why having a distinct voice and positioning makes your SEO efforts actually stick (aka: how to rank and be remembered). \n* Content that converts and climbs: The art of writing for people and search engines. Plus, the case for long-form, faceless videos, and how content strategy supports retention. \n* Social media as the amplifier: How social signals, shareable content, and micro-SEO moments on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok drive discovery and build authority. \n* What startups get wrong (and how to fix it): Misaligned messaging, “too soon” SEO, or “just blogging”—the traps early-stage startups fall into and how to shift.",

      "Imagine a single element, found in nature and invisible to the naked eye, dating back to the ancient texts of Aristotle and sitting at the center of a revolutionary modern-day $1 trillion market. This unexpected and underestimated component is a native stingless bee found across the tropical belt --generating oxygen for the planet, revolutionary pharmaceutical breakthroughs, and food supply equilibrium from the most critical regions around the globe. Today, a Native Pollination Technology (Polli-Tech) is leading the way in nature-based technologies, expanded by new Native Footprint (NFP) and Micro-Biomes Credit (MBC) standards. These integrative approaches enable a hives relocation program (AMAZHONEY) in remote schools and critical regions, to better trace pollination patterns for researchers and stakeholders to pioneer strategies and translate climate assets for business resilience and biodiversity adaptation, replicating successful frameworks across the pollination production and supply chain to meet local and transnational development targets. Following presentations at Climate Week NYC and Davos World Biodiversity Forum, this session held by the Global Portal institute* will present the Polli-Tech sector and explore its respective leverages: - Comprehensive analytics on human-environment interactions forming the foundation of economy; - The effective scaling of critical resources through the latest legacy technological practices; - An innovative global Nest-Work mapping the sector to reinforce adaptive actions; - The implementation and monitoring existing of Queen Banks, and natural firewall for climate upheavals. As Albert Einstein said: “The measure of intelligence is the ability to change”",

We’ll break into two focused conversations, one on building powerful communities, the other on using AI to scale them, so you can engage where it matters most. Siam Hossain, founder of Algorizin, scaled his community to over 200k members and built a 7-figure revenue business, he’ll share his playbook, the challenges he faced, and the key decisions that made all the difference in growing his community. Then, we’ll bring in the power of AI with Frederike Falke, founder of NxtCRM AI, who’ll break down how AI can supercharge your community growth in today’s fast-moving landscape. She’ll share her hands-on experiences building an AI community in New York and the strategies that actually work. This isn’t just theory, it’s real tips from people who’ve been in the trenches. We’ll talk: 🔥 Community growth – how to go from zero to a thriving, engaged audience 🚀 Company growth (0-1) – the make-or-break moments in the early days 🧦 AI’s role in scaling – how to leverage tech to grow faster & smarter 💡 Challenges & learnings – the mistakes, pivots, and wins you need to know If you’re a founder or just passionate about building communities, this is your chance to ask questions, get real answers, and walk away with tactics you can use immediately. No fluff: just honest, relatable stories and the kind of insights you won’t find in a generic blog post. Come for the knowledge, stay for the connections, and leave ready to build something incredible. Let’s make it happen - see you there!",

This is why we are so excited to bring a unique panel of founders building in the experiential economy space to Tech Week to discuss what they are building, current trends, pitfalls and opportunities in the space, and where they see the space going in the next decade. We will not only discuss trends in direct-to-consumer experiences but also cover how various businesses have excelled in using IRL opportunities for customer activation or employee retention. We will also discuss what it's like to fundraise in the space. The night will end with time for networking with others passionate about the IRL Renaissance happening today.",

But here’s the rub - a lot of PMMs in this setup end up executing, rather than leading. They get pulled into sales decks and launch checklists… and slowly drift away from customer insight, product influence, and strategy. Meanwhile, Product Marketers sitting in the product team often report becoming a glorified Jira ticket closer. This structure gives PMMs influence on roadmap, pricing, packaging, and market fit. But we've seen plenty of PMMs get so embedded with product that they lose touch with customers and GTM starts to suffer. So, what’s the sweet spot?

      'A walking salon exploring what parts of human struggle, inefficiency, and learning are worth preserving in the age of AI. Join us in “choosing to walk” while discussing topics like how to cultivate genuine curiosity in an age of instant answers, or how play brings motivation to learning. As Rayne Fisher-Quann writes, walking is “rarely the most popular, the most effective, or the most efficient way of getting to your destination….When you choose to walk, you choose not to pursue immediate gratification or even comfort but simply to expand the number of things that might happen to you. Walking invests in the potentiality of your experience with almost no promise of tangible reward at all, which is something like being alive." Practice what you discuss, walking and reflecting on our unquestioned ideals of convenience and innovation, hopefully leading to a better collective sense of what separates our humanity from AI. Map + discussion questions are forthcoming! This event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem. Learn more at www.tech-week.com.',

A year after their memorable NY Tech Week 2024 discussion, Andrew Chen (General Partner, a16z) and Ian Goldstein (Startup & Venture Partner, Fenwick) reunite to explore how AI continues to reshape the consumer and entertainment landscape—this time joined by Gaurav Misra, CEO of Captions, the breakout AI video creation platform and a New York-based a16z portfolio company. From creator tools and social content to digital storytelling and cultural trends, the conversation will unpack how AI applications have evolved over the past year—and where they're headed next. What’s hype, what’s real, and what should founders and creatives be watching as AI moves from experimental to essential, with a perspective specific to the New York experience and ecosystem. Expect sharp insights, candid takes, and real-world perspectives from the frontlines of tech, venture, and entrepreneurship.",

With political uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, founders today face more policy challenges than ever before. But what if the path forward isn’t to fight the system, but to rebuild it from within? Featuring Odyssey, a govtech company transforming access to education, this conversation will dive deep into how startups in highly regulated spaces can innovate, build trust, and win in a world where policy shapes markets. Moderated by Bradley Tusk of Tusk Venture Partners, this panel will ask the hard questions: - Can startups still win when the state is your biggest stakeholder — or your biggest threat? - When does regulation become a moat, not a minefield? - What kind of founder builds for systems most fear to touch? If you’re building in AI, fintech, edtech, govtech or just curious where power is shifting next — this event is for you.

Then we’ll shift into après lunch at noon, with two return buses heading back to the city at 12:30 and 1:30. ​Whether you’re here to connect with other VCs and founders or just want to shred a few laps on North America’s only indoor snow dome, this one’s about community, conversation, and carving it up. ​I’m Mike Ma, GP at Sidecut Ventures and former PSIA-AASI National Team Member. Snowboarding’s been a lifelong passion, and I’ll be out there riding with you—offering tips while listening to pitches, and soaking up the good vibes.

We are strategists and AI architects, and by agentifying our operations completely, we freed up time: - To spend more time with our clients in meaningful conversations - To spend more time with our engineers fine‑tuning our tools - To ideate and innovate new AI solutions - To have more time as a team to strategize and clarify our direction This is not a panel. Not a demo. This is execution. What to Expect - Live voice‑to‑CRM agent demo built in n8n and deployed in both Palantir AIP and lightweight tools - Automated deal creation, follow‑ups, proposal and contract generation—demonstrated in real time - Under‑the‑hood view of our exact sales‑agent templates and prompt structures Why Attend (outcomes by role) - Founders: Capture every investor and customer interaction by voice—no extra headcount needed. - GTM & Sales Ops: Slash prospecting and follow‑up time in half—automate sequences and hit quota faster. - B2B & Ops Leaders: Build an AI “command center” for real‑time insights, freeing your team for strategic work. - Series A+ Founders + GTM Leaders: Access a complimentary Digital Credibility Audit (value of $525) from Oh Hello Agency—because reputation precedes revenue.

      "Curious about angel investing, but not sure where to start? You don’t need a finance degree or millions in the bank to become an angel investor. You do need curiosity, drive, and a desire to use your money to shape the future. ​Join us on June 4th for a lunch and learn session led by Maaike Doyer, Managing Partner at Epic Angels, where we’ll break down the basics of angel investing—what it is, how it works, and how you can get started. ​This session is for female aspiring angel investors who want to learn, connect, and explore what it means to invest not just with capital, but with intention. ​\n\nWhat we’ll cover:\n- What is angel investing, really? No jargon, just the essentials.\n- How much do I need to get started? Less than you think.\n- Why do women investors matter? The power of putting your money where your values are.\n- How to become part of Epic Angels- the largest global female investor collective. ​\n\nWhy you should join: Because we need more women writing the checks. And because investing isn’t just about returns—it’s about influence, access, and impact. Whether you're new to investing or already active in business, this session is designed to give you clarity, confidence, and community.",

Our events are like The Amazing Race combined with Sleep No More and Pub Trivia, all on the streets of NYC. They're designed to wow and delight as you explore the city as you’ve never seen it before. Terminal Time Trial is entirely set in Grand Central Terminal; explore the hidden hallways, delicious vendors, and compelling history of this NYC landmark. At the end of the event, you will arrive at a top-secret finish line location (food and drink available to purchase) where you will have a chance to meet and greet with other participants. Be advised: this is a collaborative event. Sleuths in teams of four will compete to win honor and acclaim.

This isn’t just a wellness device anymore — with Loftie Labs, it becomes a fully programmable, Raspberry Pi–style platform designed to help kids (and their parents) build better routines and learn to code. With Loftie Labs, we’re merging STEM and self-care in a way that’s never been done before. Kids and teens will be able to personalize their clocks, design their own wellness routines, and explore real-world coding skills through our AI-powered Loftie Labs App. This intimate evening invites teens, parents, educators, and builders to share ideas, brainstorm features, and help shape the future of programmable wellness for the next generation. We’ll be gathering early feedback on Loftie Labs and the coding app experience, and want to hear directly from the people who will use it. Enjoy mocktails, light bites, and creative brainstorming activities, with giveaways and exclusive access to beta test Loftie Labs this summer. Why It Matters: Loftie Labs isn’t just a software update — it’s a reframing of how technology can empower kids to sleep better, learn faster, and take charge of their routines. It’s coding with a purpose, wellness without the screens, and a new way for families to connect over tech that truly supports them.

      "Let's be honest - trading no longer belongs to humans. Today, it's all about algorithms and AI models that see patterns we'd never spot on our own. If you're building, scaling, or just plain obsessed with the future of trading tech, this meetup is for you. We're bringing together founders, quants, and engineers who aren't content to follow yesterday's rules. This is your chance to connect with people who are hands-on—launching real products, solving hard problems, and figuring out how to get AI from the lab into live markets. It doesn't matter if you're working solo or as part of a bigger team. What matters is you're trying something new. Expect straight talk about what it really takes to build and run scalable, AI-powered trading systems-no sales pitches, no empty buzzwords. You'll hear story about shipping fast with small teams, wrangling real-time data, and designing for both speed and reliability. Bring your toughest questions, your wildest ideas, and an open mind. Whether you're in the weeds with code, planning your next launch, or just want to meet others who 'get it' - you'll walk away with real connections and new inspiration. If you think trading should belong to the bold - and you're excited about where AI can take us next - you'll fit right in.

      "Your competitors are already automating core operations with GenAI, and they’re not waiting for you to catch up. This is not a panel or a fireside chat. It’s a closed-door working session for enterprise leaders who are done talking and ready to execute. At the AWS x Karini AI Executive Forum during NY Tech Week, you’ll sit with the architects of real-world GenAI deployments from Fortune 500 companies. You’ll walk out with a tactical blueprint tailored to your business, not a brochure filled with buzzwords. This session is built for operations leaders under pressure to reduce waste, business unit heads accountable for revenue and efficiency, and transformation executives who are tired of vendor theater. You’ll see a live GenAI workflow built on the spot, get a six-month deployment advantage by skipping the proof-of-concept phase, and gain visibility into what your industry peers have already automated. The outcome is a practical, execution-ready roadmap that works without waiting on IT. By 2026, GenAI-enabled automation will redefine enterprise operations. Leaders who delay will fall behind. This forum bridges the gap between business strategy and AI execution in plain language with immediate impact. If you’re serious about results, this is the room you need to be in. Attendance is limited to 20. Apply now or be left watching from the sidelines. This event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Surrounded by the visual language of history’s most consequential messaging campaigns, we’ll explore the arms race in AI through the lens of its spiritual predecessors: the Cold War, the Space Race, and the myth of nuclear utopia. BTS is our traveling, closed-door series where creative leaders, technologists, and strategists go off-script to share the untold stories behind ambitious work. We’ve hosted 11 sessions in three countries—New York, San Francisco, and Toronto—welcoming more than 2,000 attendees. Every BTS follows Chatham House Rule, with a strict no-phone, no-photo, no-video policy—so people say what they really think. The result? Conversations that simply don’t happen anywhere else. With special guests from both sides of the debate, we’ll pull back the curtain on what’s coming—and what it takes to tell a story powerful enough to shape the future.

      "Founders know growth is essential — but too often, it’s expensive, chaotic, and misaligned with what investors actually want to see. Over lunch at Pera Soho, Rosy Finch Method & Co. creates space for a conversation on how to build high-output, capital-efficient GTM functions from day one. We’ll talk about designing lean systems that scale without blowing through your raise — and how to make marketing and sales best friends early, not rivals reporting different KPIs and fighting for credit. If you’re rethinking how to go to market in 2025, this is your table. This event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

At the AWS x Karini AI Executive Forum, you’ll be introduced to the Matriarchal AI Management (MAM) framework, the first governance model built specifically for generative AI agent ecosystems at enterprise scale. This is not a conversation about ethics or future possibilities. It’s a working session for leaders who need operational control now. Enterprises are moving from managing code to managing autonomous systems, and traditional IT governance is already failing under that shift. This forum brings together CIOs, CTOs, heads of AI and ML operations, and compliance officers facing regulatory scrutiny and real-time complexity. You’ll gain the tools to identify and control shadow agents, secure agent-to-agent interactions, and monitor the health of your AI ecosystem with precision. MAM equips you to lead with real-time observability, enforce policy, and scale safely. The bottom line: unmanaged AI is a liability. MAM gives you the framework to take control.",

      "Step away from the noise of Tech Week and into something more real. Join us for an off-the-record evening designed exclusively for founders. We’re bringing together 20 exceptional entrepreneurs (Seed to Series B) for an intimate experience that goes beyond surface-level networking. This curated gathering invites you to connect through honest conversation and meaningful reflection, with no pitches, no panels, and no posturing. You’ll be matched in smaller peer groups for guided discussions led by experienced facilitators. Through thought-provoking prompts, founder-to-founder dialogue, and a few unexpected touches, this is your chance to step into a space built on trust, curiosity, and shared experience. We’re focusing on founders who are Seed stage or beyond, or generating at least $500K in annual revenue. It’s also an opportunity to experience what Pando’s founder peer groups are all about. Some delicious food and drinks will be served in a cozy, convivial setting that’s meant to feel warm, relaxed, and welcoming. More like a pause with friends than a performance. By application only.",

      "As frontier models become widely available — open-sourced, commoditized, or served via API — the real competitive edge in AI shifts away from what you're running to how you run it. In 2025, infrastructure is the new moat. This session dives into the technical, strategic, and operational layers that turn infra from cost center to unfair advantage. We’ll explore what elite infra stacks look like behind top AI products, what makes them hard to replicate, and how infra decisions shape velocity, cost, performance, and ultimately — market dominance.",

Whether you’re Seed or Series A, the path to scalable revenue and investor confidence is paved with smart, tested GTM moves—and this session gives you a rare chance to get real-time advice from those who’ve done it at the highest level. Startup-IQ’s Founders GTM Office Hours is not a panel, and it’s not a pitch competition. It’s a fast-moving, highly interactive session where you bring your toughest GTM questions—and get direct, no-fluff feedback from: -> Jack Nolan, a sales and GTM leader who’s built and scaled revenue engines across startups and global giants. -> Michael Queralt, a Y Combinator alum and founder who’s helped countless startups navigate funding, product-market fit, and sustainable growth. But that’s not all—this format lets you learn from the challenges, insights, and strategies of your fellow founders. Hear what’s working (and what’s not), exchange ideas, and build tactical knowledge you can act on immediately. Why This Matters: Founders ask. Founders learn. You’re not just listening—you’re participating. - Live, practical feedback on sales strategy, pricing, investor readiness, traction, and more. - Proven GTM frameworks you can plug into your startup right now. - Unfiltered insights from startup peers who are in the trenches with you. Whether you\'re still trying to validate your ICP or racing toward your next round, this is the room that will level up your GTM game. Space is limited. Insights are not. Come ready. Leave sharper.

Held at Aprio’s offices, the event will feature a panel of dual-use investors exploring how capital and innovation intersect to drive national advantage. Attendees will include top-tier VCs, corporate venture leaders from defense primes, and early-to-mid-stage dual-use startups. With a curated, high-signal audience and intimate format, this event offers rare access to the people shaping the future of dual-use innovation. Our panel will feature leading voices from the corporate venture arms of major federal contractors: Ali Perez of Lockheed Martin Ventures, Michael Hauser of SAIC Ventures, and Bill Collier of Noblis Ventures. The conversation will be moderated by Matt Byington of General Catalyst, whose national perspective from outside DC adds important dimension to a dialogue often rooted in the Beltway. Together, these leaders will offer insider insight into how corporate venture teams evaluate emerging technologies, partner with startups, and align investments with mission priorities—offering a rare window into how capital, capability, and national interest converge to accelerate innovation at scale.

      "Behind every health stat is a lived story—and for women, those stories have been ignored and poorly understood for too long. But that’s changing. Join us for a conversation about how data, design, and a new generation of women-led innovation are bringing visibility, intelligence, and continuity to women's health. Join us for a fireside chat featuring three women deeply immersed in reimagining care: - Dr Estelle Giraud, PhD co-founder and CEO of Trellis Health, building the infrastructure for generational health - Dr. Hillary Lin, a physician-entrepreneur and cofounder of elevateX, elevating healthcare via AI-enabled precision longevity - Naseem Sayani, investor at How Women Invest and previously founding partner at Emmeline Ventures, backing the startups reshaping women’s lived experience through health, finance, and family systems. Together, they’ll unpack the new science of women's health, the emerging companies and trends in venture investment across the category, and the growing business models and access points for consumers. We’ll explore the new tools helping women understand their bodies- from biomarkers to blueprints, and the care models that reflect the way we actually live. If you building in or are curious about women’s health, if you believe longevity should be intelligent and inclusive, if you’re ready to see what happens when data meets design with empathy—this is the room to be in. This isn't your mom's healthcare system anymore. This event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
