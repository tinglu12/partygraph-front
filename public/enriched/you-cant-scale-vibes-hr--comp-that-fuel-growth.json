  "description": "Let's get real—your startup might thrive on energy, vision, and good vibes right now, but that doesn't scale. Many startups hit growth mode without clear structures for talent and human capital, leading to retention challenges and difficulty recruiting top talent. This Tech Week, join Aaron Thweatt (Executive Coach and former SpaceX compensation strategist who structured 3,000+ job offers during hypergrowth) as he breaks down how to build a scalable HR and compensation philosophy. Learn to create clarity and trust without bureaucracy, avoid common pitfalls that cause top talent to leave, and lay the groundwork for sustainable growth. Whether you're a founder planning your next hires or a fractional leader managing growth, this session will equip you with essential frameworks to scale your company effectively and retain your best people. This event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem. Learn more at www.tech-week.com.",
