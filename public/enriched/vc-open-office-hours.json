  "description": "In these distributed meetings from June 3rd-6th, founders meet real VCs and discuss their idea in a 20-minute intro session. These meetings are not about getting a fundraising check by the end of your chat - rather it's about convincing them to take another meeting for a deeper dive. After you RSVP, you will receive a link to sign up for meetings with investors. This event is a part of #NYTechWeekâ€”a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
