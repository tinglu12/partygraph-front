  "description": "This salon-style fireside chat and networking reception will bring together leaders in AI, oncology and pet lovers to explore how AI and data are fighting cancer - on both sides of the leash. Cancer is the number one killer of dogs and the largest unmet need for pet care, and what we learn from pet cancer journeys can also help inform cures for human health. Join us to hear Christina Lopes, CEO and co-founder of FidoCure, lead a conversation about these topics! This event is a part of #NYTechWeekâ€”a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem. Learn more at www.tech-week.com.",
