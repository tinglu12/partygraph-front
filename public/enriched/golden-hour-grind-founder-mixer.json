  "description": "Calling all Gen Z builders, dreamers, and disruptors! GFR Fund & Supernode Global is creating a space for Gen Z builders, founders, and investors together in one of the most electric tech hubs in the country 🗽✨🍎 If you’re not Gen Z but you’re excited about what we’re building and want to be part of the conversation, pull up! This is a night all about serendipitous connections, tasty bites & drinks, fireside chats, and quickfire pitches. 📅 Tuesday, June 3 | 4:00 PM – 6:00 PM ET 📍 NoMad (exact location released to approved guests) 💡 Wanna pitch? Got something exciting in the works and want some live feedback in front of GFR & SG's GPs and community? Get on the list! We're keeping it casual, think open mic nights: no decks, and keep it under 2 minutes. Be ready to answer questions and give feedback to your fellow pitchers! Spots are limited. https://airtable.com/appyIuRkH38r2vaZN/pag2ag5qJDQz5Cn8f/form Brought to you by GFR Fund 🦵 and Supernode Global 🧡 This event is a part of #NYTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.
